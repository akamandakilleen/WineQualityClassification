# WineQualityClassification
#### by Amanda Killeen

## Problem & Motivation
They say to never judge a book by its cover, but I almost exclusively judge a wine by it’s label. When selecting a wine, if it’s just for me, I’ll go for something towards the bottom shelf (i.e. cheaper) with a cool looking label; if it’s for a special occasion, I’ll look towards the top shelves (i.e. pricier) and again, the label wins. 

A few years ago, I moved to Oregon wine country and since then, I have developed an interest in wine, and I am interested in what characteristics really makes a good quality or a bad quality wine, which give notes of rich stone fruits or something more akin to oak?  My project uses the Wine Data Set from UCI and classification techniques (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest) to determine which features make a good quality wine versus a bad quality wine and predict quality. 

## Dataset Information
**UCI Machine Learning Repository, Wine Data Set**

Modeling wine preferences by data mining from physicochemical properties. In Decision Support Systems, Elsevier, 47(4):547-553, 2009.*

The dataset is based on Portuguese ‘Vinho Verde’ wine and there are CSV files available for both White and Red wine. Itis multivariate, contains **6497 rows**, and has **12 key attributes** divided into objective and subjective. 

## Tools
- Python
- Python Packages: Sci-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, NumPy
